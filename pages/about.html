          <p>
            The simplest thing is to understand the value in nature and realise that we don’t even need so much artificial around us to be happy and feel good is to simply engage with nature. Like Svetlana Alexievich said, “With fresh eyes, I look at the world around me. A little ant is crawling on the ground, and now it is closer to me. A bird flies in the sky, and it too is closer. The distance between us shrinks. The previous chasm is gone. All is life.”  
            Therefore we asked ourselves: How can we reach people (who are not already in the bubble) to engage more with nature on a daily basis?

          <h1>Technology</h1>
          <p>
            As mentioned in the Green Marx, technology is often used as a tool of domination over nature. While not directly enabling nature-connections, it can also be used as a reason for taking the first step. As part of this intervention, we chose to “hide” possibilities for nature-connections behind QR-Codes on fancy stickers, thereby using the “naturality” of our technology-use as a vehicle to a nature-connection.

          <h1>Individual</h1>
          <p>
            Experiencing nature and understanding one's own connections within nature, is always a uniquely personal and individual experience. Such understanding is formed by one’s own senses, and not by interpretation of another's information.It relies in large part on “intuitive” information, e.g. information which, for sake of efficiency, is not made available as part of the “conscious” mental experience. A colorful sticker may provide a shallow distraction from daily life, but a short text can then provide so many more questions regarding what else one may have missed thus far, and, knowingly or not, lead to intuitive, “natural” experiences, no matter how short.

          <h1>Nature</h1>
          <p>
            Nature is all around as, at all times. The common conception, that we live in nature, albeit true, often ignores that we also are nature, or “natural”. This gap in perception is deeply rooted in centuries of subjugation and attempts at domination. Our hope is to provide small opportunities to bridge that gap in day to day life and become more aware of nature not as something in which we build our cities to carve out a living, but as something surrounding us, making a living and surviving around us at all times. Most importantly, we want it to be seen not as something to push away unless on vacation, but as something to engage with in every moment.

          <h1>Society</h1>
          <p>
            Different societies have developed many different ways to (dis-)engage with nature over the centuries. Maybe due to the inherent immediate profitability, it is mostly exploitative methods that shaped and now dominate a large portion of the world. For a society to exploit any system though, a certain (emotional) disconnect must exist, as well as a devaluation of the content/members of said system. By reconnecting back to nature, individuals break societal patterns on a small scale. They learn to appreciate nature without a (direct) commercialisable value as still (or all the more) being valuable, and may thus see societies actions towards the natural environment as increasingly problematic.

          <h1>Democracy</h1>
          <p>
            Democracy, powerful tool that it is, sees its biggest issue when confronted with a participant without a voice. No bird, mammal, tree, flower, funghi or insect will ever partake in our democracy, yet they are deeply affected by it. Nor would they necessarily want to, at least presumably. Still, we want to speak for them, if not for them, then for us, as they are us, they are our world, and though this world may survive in some way, it is not the world that we, in this democracy, want for us.
            We are only six people though, so we also hoped for our intervention to be a tool of connection. The website provides a mail-address to give feedback and get into contact. The stickers are hopefully fancy enough to be talked about, and given enough time could be plentiful enough to surely be talked about.
            Finally, given more time and long-term financial capabilities, it would in theory be possible to allow anyone to add more information to the website, potentially engaging people all over the world.
